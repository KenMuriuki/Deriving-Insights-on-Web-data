# Deriving Insights on Web data

A Kenyan Entreprenuer wishes to understand their online audience better so as to improve sales of an online course. To help with this, they have collected data on people visiting their website with an intent of deriving useful insights so as to better execute their subsequent ad campaigns. 

In this notebook, I have derived key isnights that will enable drive online sales for the entreprenuer. I have used a simple univariate and bivariate exploratiry data analysis using R programming to identify the key insights.
